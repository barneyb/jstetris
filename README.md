# jstetris

Super simple JS Tetris game implemented in parellel with Brenna's version of the same.

The intent is NOT to be a good tetris implementation, but rather to slowly build up the game in really tiny pieces, with explicit motivation for every little change (for both "business" and "technical" requirements).

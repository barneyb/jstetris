# jstetris

Super simple JS Tetris game implemented in parellel with Brenna's version of the same.

The intent is NOT to be a good tetris implementation, but rather to slowly build up the game in really tiny pieces, with explicit motivation for every little change (for both "business" and "technical" requirements).

It's ready to play at http://barneyb.github.io/jstetris/

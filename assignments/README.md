This directory contains the pieces of functionality that need to be implemented
in order to make your Tetris game work. Make sure you get each piece working
correctly before you move on to the next one, as later pieces depend on
earlier ones. Since this isn't nearly as fancy as CodeCombat or CodeAcademy,
when you make a change, save your file, and hit reload in the browser to see
the updated code.

Each assignment has some comments describing what you need to do, as well as
laying out any information you might need in order to complete it. It also
has the function that you'll need to implement, commented out. As long as the
function is commented out, the game will work with it's own internal logic.
As soon as the function is uncommented, it'll start being used (and since
it's empty, the game will undoubtedly break). The first thing you should do
for EVERY assignment is to uncomment the function, and refresh to see it
break. Then you can start filling in the function.

While you're working, if you just comment out the whole function again, the
game will go back to it's original behaviour. So you can always 'undo' your
changes by commenting out your function, without having to delete it.

It will also be helpful to keep the developer tools open so you can see the
console. That way you can see if there are any errors, but more importantly,
you can use the `console.log` function to print out messages and/or variable
to see what's going on.
